2012-12-30 to 2012-12-31

Added to D-LFS.config: export DEV_LBL = LFS-NEW   # Label for $DEV_LFS partition
  Used in 2.03_Creating_File_System

Sections 5.08 on have "shifted" regarding the package within.
So,"(no changes)" refers to the package, with its new section number,
not neccessarily the old section number.  Same for 6.20 on.

2013-01-01
Fixed a couple typos introduced above.
Added additional, optional, parameters to Build_Common_Package

In Prepare_Package and cleanup, replaced use of $SOURCES_DIR with:
cd $LFS_SOURCES

2013-01-06
Changed $BUILD_DATA to $BUILD_INFO
In header, moved Press_Enter_to_continue to after Display_Estimated_Times_Total

In footer, still show "Error "'s, but don't show "(ignored)" errors.

Probably a few other misc changes to various package scripts.

2013-01-08 00:05
D-LFS.functions line 413: Calculate_ABUS_and_DIFF
  Now: DIFF = ABUS - SBUS
  Was:      = SBUS - ABUS
  ie: First value (estimated time) is subtracted from second value (actual time)
  Similar to      (Start time)     is subtracted from              (Finish time)

2013-01-10 00:00+
In Press_R_to_Review_build_log, reduced number of echo's before prompt.


2013-01-10
In each of the following (& a few others):
5.09_GCC-Pass2 6.13_Binutils 6.09_Glibc 6.24_E2fsprogs
  added missing $ to BUILD_LOG in a few spots.

2013-01-17
prepare_pacakge: if package file not found, exit build.(before just gave error)

2013-01-18
In 7.02, 7.03, 8.02, and possibly a couple others, changed method of creating
file from a bunch of "echo blah blah  >> /some/file", to:
cat > /some/file < EOF   #Note that EOF is not quoted

2013-01-20
0/summary_screen now uses cat > $BUILD_LOG << EOF for entire screen.
7/8.02_etc_fstab  Fixed bug introduced sometime over the past few days.

2013-01-21 ...
1.00: Removed superfluous echo of start time.

Tweaked the 0.00_template

log_start_time values now echo'd to $BUILD_TIMES by log_end_time.

header: Cooresponding improvement to Display_Estimated_Times_Package

prepage_package: exit build on any error.
                 Option to skip "Building..." msg.

Display_Estimated_Times_Package: improved a bit - 
   now always displays in header, both on screen & in log. (uses tput & sed)

2013-01-25 Added Progress_Bar()
