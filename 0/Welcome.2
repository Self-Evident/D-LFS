  3) Run 0/version_check.sh, and resolve any host system requirements.

  4) Make sure these scripts are in a directory called "scripts".

  5) Download source files and required patches (see section 3.1 in the book).
     Place them in a directory called "sources" that is NOT on $LFS

  6) The "sources" and "scripts" directories must be in the same directory.
     This location must NOT be be on your future LFS partion.

  7) Prepare a Linux partion to house your LFS build.
     (See section 2.2 in the LFS book)

  8) Configure your setup in the D-LFS.config file.
     (The only values that usually need changed are DEV_LFS & DEV_SWP)
